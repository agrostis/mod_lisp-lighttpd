This is a branch of mod_lisp for the Lighttpd server.  The original mod_lisp
(for Apache) has been written by Marc Battyani and based on the example module
from the Apache distribution, and various other modules.  mod_lisp-lighttpd is
based on modules provided with the Lighttpd source, primarily mod_proxy.

Versions of mod_lisp-lighttpd are numbered L.<M>.<N> to distinguish them from
the Apache branch.  The current version is L.0.2, which matches Lighttpd vv.
1.4.15 upto and including 1.4.19. 


[Contents of the distribution]

  Makefile.in-1.4.15.patch  -  a patch for lighttpd-1.4.15/src/Makefile.in
  Makefile.in-1.4.18.patch  -  a patch for lighttpd-1.4.18/src/Makefile.in
  Makefile.in-1.4.19.patch  -  a patch for lighttpd-1.4.19/src/Makefile.in
  mod_lisp.c                -  the module source
  mod_lisp.README           -  this notice


[Installation]

Lighttpd must be recompiled and reinstalled with mod_lisp added to its
source.  For this end, download and unpack lighttpd, e.g. from
http://www.lighttpd.net/download/lighttpd-1.4.M.tar.gz (where M is the
minor version), and then continue as follows (I presuppose a Unix-like
environment):

1. Copy mod_lisp.c and Makefile.in-1.4.M.patch to lighttpd-1.4.M/src.
2. Chdir to lighttpd-1.4.M/src and apply the patch by running 
   ``patch < Makefile.in-1.4.M.patch''.
3. Build and install Lighttpd as described in the INSTALL file for that
   distribution.


[Configuration]

mod_lisp-lighttpd is configured via the Lighttpd configuration file which
can ordinarily be found at /usr/local/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf,
/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf, or some similar location.  Please refer to
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/wiki/Docs for the general description of the
file's syntax and semantics.  To make Lighttpd load mod_lisp, include
the string "mod_lisp" in the list server.modules, e.g.:

  server.modules      = ( "mod_access",
                          "mod_lisp",
                          "mod_cgi",
                          "mod_accesslog" )

Options for mod_lisp are pretty straightforward:

  ## The port on which a Lisp listens for incoming connections
  lisp.server-port    = <int>        # default: 3000

  ## The IP address for the Lisp
  lisp.server-ip      = <string>     # default: "127.0.0.1"

  ## The server-id string sent to the Lisp
  lisp.server-id      = <string>     # default: "lighttpd"

  ## How much diagnostic data written to Lighttpd error log. This tries to
  ## reproduce Apache's ap_log_error interface:
  ## LOGLEVEL_EMERG   = 0            : system is unusable
  ## LOGLEVEL_ALERT   = 1            : action must be taken immediately
  ## LOGLEVEL_CRIT    = 2            : critical conditions
  ## LOGLEVEL_ERR     = 3            : error conditions
  ## LOGLEVEL_WARNING = 4            : warning conditions
  ## LOGLEVEL_NOTICE  = 5            : normal but significant condition
  ## LOGLEVEL_INFO    = 6            : informational
  ## LOGLEVEL_DEBUG   = 7            : debug-level messages
  lisp.log-level      = <int>        # default: 4

  ## Whether requests should be handled by mod_lisp
  lisp.use-handler    = <bool>       # default: "disable"

These options are used most effectively in conjunction with conditional
sessions, e.g.:

  lisp.server-id      = "red-spiders"
  lisp.log-level      = 5

  ## Forward requests to an UnCommon Web server on localhost:
  $HTTP["url"] =~ "\.ucw([/?]|$)" {
    lisp.use-handler  = "enable"
    lisp.server-ip    = "127.0.0.1"
    lisp.log-level    = 7
  }

  ## Forward requests with a different hostname to a remote server:
  $HTTP["host"] =~ "human-sacrifice.gov" {
    lisp.use-handler = "enable"
    lisp.server-ip   = "213.155.151.152"
    lisp.log-level   = 0  # we don't meddle in government affairs
  }
